Researcher exploring quantum foundations, AI, and intelligent systems.

I work on **foundational questions in computation**, with a focus on **quantum foundations, artificial intelligence, and intelligent systems**.

My work explores how information is represented, transformed, and constrained across classical and emerging computational paradigms.

## Current work
- Quantum computation foundations and limitations  
- Design of intelligent and data-driven systems  
- Early-stage system concepts and experimental prototypes under **Ulixr Tech**

## Research approach
- Foundations over frameworks  
- Systems thinking over isolated models  
- Clarity, rigor, and experimentation over claims

This repository functions as a public research and systems notebook — documenting ideas, prototypes, and evolving lines of inquiry.
